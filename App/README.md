### Advantages I can get from a third-party library or framework.
**Speed of Development**
A framework comes up with predefined terms, by giving you the ability to use these codes instead of having to create the codes from scratch.

**Allows users to focus only on core functionality**
A framework will take care of all the nonbusiness related functionalities, such as cross-browser support, responsiveness, browser compatibility, scalability ect.. and allowing users to focus more on core business functionalities.
